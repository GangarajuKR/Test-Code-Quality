# SonarLint for Eclipse

SonarLint is an IDE extension that helps you detect and fix quality issues as you write code. Like a spell checker, SonarLint squiggles flaws so they can be fixed before committing code. You can get it directly from the [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/sonarlint) and it will then detect new bugs and quality issues as you code (for Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python and HTML).

SonarLint can optionally be connected to [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) or [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) to provide additional features.

SonarLint is also available for [Visual Studio](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarlint-visualstudio/wiki), [VS Code](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarlint-vscode/wiki), [IntelliJ](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarlint-intellij/wiki) (the languages supported vary from IDE to IDE).
